      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This page explores three important models in Human-Computer Interaction: 
        Norman's Action Cycle, the GOMS model, and the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM). 
        These frameworks help us understand and analyze how users interact with 
        computer systems, each offering different perspectives and levels of detail.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Norman's Action Cycle</h2>
      <p>
        Norman's Action Cycle, described in Human-Computer Interaction (Dix et al., 
        3rd edition, Chapter 9), provides a seven-stage framework for understanding 
        user interaction with systems. The cycle consists of forming a goal, forming 
        an intention, specifying an action, executing the action, perceiving the system 
        state, interpreting the state, and evaluating the outcome against the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This model emphasizes the cognitive processes involved in interaction and 
        identifies two critical gaps: the Gulf of Execution (the difference between 
        user intentions and allowable actions) and the Gulf of Evaluation (the effort 
        required to interpret system state). Understanding these gulfs helps designers 
        create more intuitive interfaces.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>GOMS Model</h2>
      <p>
        The GOMS model (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules), discussed in 
        Chapter 12 of the HCI textbook, provides a structured approach to modeling user 
        task performance. Unlike Norman's conceptual framework, GOMS breaks down tasks 
        into specific components that can be analyzed and quantified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Goals represent what the user wants to accomplish, Operators are the basic 
        actions available to the user, Methods are sequences of operators to achieve 
        goals, and Selection rules determine which method to use when multiple options 
        exist. GOMS is particularly useful for predicting expert user performance and 
        comparing different interface designs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>
      <p>
        The Keystroke-Level Model, also covered in Chapter 12, is a simplified version 
        of GOMS that focuses on predicting task execution time. KLM breaks tasks down 
        into primitive operators such as keystrokes, pointing with a mouse, drawing, 
        mental preparation, and system response time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each operator has an associated time value based on empirical research, allowing 
        designers to calculate total task time. For example, a keystroke takes 
        approximately 0.2 seconds, while pointing to a target with a mouse takes about 
        1.1 seconds. KLM is valuable for quick performance predictions without requiring 
        extensive user testing.

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        Through studying these three models, I learned that HCI analysis requires 
        different tools for different purposes. Norman's Action Cycle helps identify 
        why interfaces feel difficult to use by revealing mismatches between user 
        mental models and system design. It's particularly valuable during the early 
        design phase when we're thinking about overall interaction flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        GOMS provides a middle ground, offering structure for analyzing how tasks are 
        performed without requiring the detailed timing data of KLM. It's especially 
        useful when comparing alternative designs or understanding expert workflows. 
        The selection rules component helps predict user behavior when multiple paths 
        to a goal exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        KLM taught me the power of quantitative prediction in interface design. By 
        breaking tasks into primitive operations, we can estimate performance without 
        extensive user testing. This is invaluable for quick design iterations, though 
        it's limited to routine tasks performed by expert users and doesn't account 
        for learning or error recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, I learned that these models complement each other. Norman's 
        framework helps us understand the "why" of interaction problems, GOMS helps 
        structure the "what" of task procedures, and KLM quantifies the "how long" 
        for expert performance. Effective HCI analysis often requires applying multiple 
        models to gain a complete understanding of user-system interaction.
